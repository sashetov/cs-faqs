function urlify( s, l ){ // Write method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end ot hold the additional chars, and that you are given the true lenght of the string. ( java solution should use real char array for in place operation) EX: "Mr John Smith",13 -> "Mr%20John%20Smith"
